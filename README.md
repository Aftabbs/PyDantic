# PyDantic
Pydantic is a Python library used for data validation and settings management. It enforces type hints at runtime, validating the input data and converting it into the expected types. Pydantic is particularly useful in APIs, data processing pipelines, and configuration management.

## Why is Pydantic Used?

- Data Validation: Automatically validates that the data matches the specified types and constraints.
- Data Parsing: Converts input data into strongly-typed Python objects.
- Error Reporting: Provides detailed error messages when data doesn't match the expected schema.
- Serialization and Deserialization: Easily converts Python objects to JSON and vice versa.
- Integration: Works seamlessly with FastAPI for validating request/response models in web APIs.

## Use Cases of Pydantic

- FastAPI Models: Pydantic is the backbone for request and response validation in FastAPI.
- Data Pipelines: Validate and sanitize incoming data before processing.
- Configuration Management: Manage app settings from environment variables or config files.
- Serialization/Deserialization: Convert between JSON and Python objects seamlessly.
